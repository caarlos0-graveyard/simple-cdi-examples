simple-cdi-examples
==================

Just a few simple CDI examples, mostly to help newcomers to Java EE/CDI.

Those examples cover:

- `@Inject` itself;
- `@Producer`;
- `@Any`;
- `@Named`;
- `@Qualifier`;
- `@Observes`;
- `@Decorator`;
- `@Interceptor`.

Some examples may use more than one of those "features".

Every folder has his own README file which says what it
does and what it uses.
